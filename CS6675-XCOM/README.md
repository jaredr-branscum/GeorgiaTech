# Project Goal
* Explore a topic in Internet Computing
* Topic: Data Communication
# Proposed Project Overview
* Researched existing work and literature on the mechanisms required for data communication for space communications including: Digital Signal Processing, IEEE 802.11 protocols, pulse-based vs continuous wave modulation
* Designed a minimal network-layer protocol for message communication on the x-ray electromagnetic spectrum (EM)
* Conducted theoretical experiments to explore potential data rate, packet loss, and sound-to-noise ratio
* Explored the feasibility, challenges, and cost of developing a communication device to enable wireless communication on the x-ray EM
