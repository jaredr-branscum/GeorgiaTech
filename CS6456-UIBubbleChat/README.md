#Objective
Using concepts and existing academic literature learned in CS 6457, explore a topic in User Interface software.
#Proposed Project
My partner Sean and I designed and implemented a POC of new user interactions in the context of mobile messaging. Our end system is built as a mobile web application using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase multi-touch interactions for mobile messaging and message threads in chat systems, such as Slack. We also implemented a paintable canvas tool to showcase user-customized message backgrounds for their contacts.
